### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these issues:

- `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- `help wanted` - issues which need extra attention
- `documentation` - improvements or additions to documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ScrollForge.git
   cd ScrollForge
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ReyKan-KP/ScrollForge.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

## üíª Development Setup

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Update the README.md** with details of changes if applicable
2. **Update the documentation** if you're changing functionality
3. **Write or update tests** as needed
4. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
5. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
6. **Follow the style guidelines** below
7. **Request review** from maintainers

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding missing tests
- `chore:` Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `feat: add PDF annotation support`

## üé® Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep functions small and focused

```typescript
// Good
export function convertPdfToHtml(file: File): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation
}

// Bad
export function convert(f: any) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Follow naming conventions (PascalCase for components)

```tsx
// Good
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export function Button({ label, onClick, variant = 'primary' }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button className={`btn-${variant}`} onClick={onClick}>
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### CSS/Tailwind

- Use Tailwind CSS utilities when possible
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use CSS variables for theming

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Add docstrings to functions
- Keep functions pure when possible

```python
def process_pdf(file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a PDF file and extract content.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the PDF file
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing extracted content
    """
    # Implementation
```
